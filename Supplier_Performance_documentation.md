# 3.2 Supplier Performance Analysis

## Currently Implemented Metrics

### 1. Delivery Performance
```python
a) On-Time Delivery Analysis
   - On-time delivery rate calculation
   - Late delivery tracking
   - Delivery status monitoring
   Formula: on_time_rate = ((total_deliveries - late_deliveries) / total_deliveries) * 100

b) Lead Time Analysis
   - Average lead time by supplier
   - Lead time tracking
   - Trend analysis
   Metric: avg_lead_time = mean(Lead Time (Days))
```

### 2. Cost Performance
```python
a) Price Analysis
   - Unit price tracking
   - Price variance analysis
   - Price distribution analysis
   Metrics:
   - average_price = mean(SupplierUnit Price)
   - price_variance = std(SupplierUnit Price)

b) Cost Savings
   - Total savings calculation
   - Savings rate analysis
   - Savings tracking over time
   Metrics:
   - total_savings = sum(CostSavings)
   - savings_rate = (total_savings / total_spend) * 100
```

### 3. Volume Analysis
```python
a) Order Volume
   - Total orders by supplier
   - Order frequency
   - Volume trends
   Metrics:
   - total_orders = count(transactions)
   - order_volume = sum(Quantity)

b) Spend Concentration
   - Spend by supplier
   - Supplier ranking
   - Spend distribution
   Analysis:
   - spend_by_supplier = sum(Total Value) grouped by Supplier
   - supplier_ranking = rank(spend_by_supplier)
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. Data Processing
```python
def analyze_supplier_performance(self):
    """Analyze supplier performance metrics"""
    try:
        # Lead time analysis
        avg_lead_time = self.df.groupby('Supplier')['Lead Time (Days)'].mean()

        # Delivery performance
        delivery_stats = (
            self.df.groupby('Supplier')
            .agg({
                'Is_Late': ['count', 'sum']
            })
        )
        delivery_stats['on_time_rate'] = 
            ((delivery_stats['total_deliveries'] - delivery_stats['late_deliveries']) / 
            delivery_stats['total_deliveries'] * 100)

        # Price analysis
        price_stats = self.df.groupby('Supplier').agg({
            'SupplierUnit Price': ['mean', 'std'],
            'CostSavings': 'sum'
        })

        return {
            'avg_lead_time': avg_lead_time,
            'delivery_performance': delivery_stats,
            'price_stats': price_stats
        }
```

### 2. Visualization Components
```python
1. Performance Metrics Display
   - Summary cards showing key metrics
   - Trend charts for delivery performance
   - Price distribution visualizations

2. Comparative Analysis
   - Supplier ranking charts
   - Performance benchmarking
   - Year-over-year comparisons

3. Interactive Elements
   - Supplier selection filters
   - Date range selectors
   - Metric toggles
```

### 3. Performance Reports
```python
1. Generated Reports Include:
   - Delivery performance summary
   - Cost analysis breakdown
   - Volume analysis
   - Savings achievements

2. Export Capabilities:
   - CSV download option
   - Formatted performance tables
   - Detailed supplier metrics
```

## Potential Future Enhancements

If you'd like to add quality metrics in the future, we could implement:

```python
1. Quality Metrics
   - Defect rates tracking
   - Return rates monitoring
   - Quality compliance scoring
   Required new data fields:
   - DefectCount
   - ReturnCount
   - QualityScore

2. Enhanced Performance Scoring
   - Composite supplier scores
   - Quality-adjusted performance metrics
   - Risk-weighted evaluations

3. Advanced Analytics
   - Predictive performance modeling
   - Risk assessment
   - Supplier optimization recommendations
```

Would you like me to:
1. Add code for implementing any of these new features?
2. Enhance existing metrics?
3. Add more visualization options?
4. Include additional analysis components?
