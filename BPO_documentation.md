# Bundle Purchase Opportunities Analysis Documentation

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
1. **Transaction Grouping**
   - Group transactions by date, category, and supplier
   - Create a binary purchase matrix where:
     * Rows represent transaction dates
     * Columns represent category-supplier combinations
     * Values: 1 (purchase occurred) or 0 (no purchase)

2. **Time Window Segmentation**
   - Default analysis period: 6 months rolling
   - Adjustable based on business seasonality
   - Minimum data points requirement: 30 transactions

### 2. Correlation Analysis
1. **Purchase Pattern Matrix Creation**
   ```python
   purchase_patterns = pd.crosstab(
       df['Transaction Date'],
       [df['Category'], df['Supplier']]
   )
   ```

2. **Correlation Calculation**
   - Uses Pearson correlation coefficient
   - Formula: r = cov(X,Y) / (σx * σy)
   - Implementation:
     ```python
     correlations = purchase_patterns.corr()
     ```

3. **Statistical Significance**
   - Minimum sample size determination:
     * n > 30 for normal approximation
     * Confidence level: 95%
   - P-value threshold: 0.05

### 3. Bundle Identification Algorithm
1. **Initial Screening**
   ```python
   for i in range(len(correlations.columns)):
       for j in range(i + 1, len(correlations.columns)):
           if correlations.iloc[i, j] >= min_correlation:
               # Potential bundle identified
   ```

2. **Co-occurrence Validation**
   ```python
   co_occurrences = len(purchase_patterns[
       (purchase_patterns[item1] > 0) & 
       (purchase_patterns[item2] > 0)
   ])
   ```

3. **Savings Potential Calculation**
   - Base formula: Savings = (Item1_Value + Item2_Value) * Discount_Rate
   - Discount_Rate default: 10%
   - Adjustments based on:
     * Purchase volume
     * Historical pricing
     * Market conditions

### 4. Threshold Optimization Process
1. **Base Threshold Determination**
   ```python
   base_thresholds = {
       'correlation': 0.60,
       'frequency': 3
   }
   ```

2. **Context-Based Adjustments**
   - Business size factor:
     * Small: -0.10
     * Medium: 0
     * Large: +0.10
   - Industry factor:
     * Manufacturing: +0.10
     * Retail: -0.05
     * Services: -0.10
   - Risk tolerance factor:
     * Low: +0.15
     * Medium: 0
     * High: -0.15

3. **Dynamic Threshold Calculation**
   ```python
   final_correlation = base_threshold +
       size_adjustment +
       industry_adjustment +
       risk_adjustment +
       volume_adjustment +
       seasonality_adjustment
   ```

### 5. Confidence Scoring Methodology
1. **Base Score Calculation**
   - Starting confidence: 1.0
   - Weighted adjustments based on:
     * Correlation strength
     * Co-occurrence frequency
     * Data volume
     * Business context

2. **Adjustment Factors**
   ```python
   if correlation < 0.5: confidence *= 0.8
   if frequency < 3: confidence *= 0.85
   if business_size == 'small' and correlation > 0.7:
       confidence *= 0.9
   ```

### 6. Validation Process
1. **Historical Performance**
   - Compare predicted vs. actual bundle performance
   - Track implementation success rate
   - Monitor savings realization

2. **Quality Checks**
   - Data completeness validation
   - Statistical significance testing
   - Outlier detection and handling

3. **Continuous Improvement**
   - Regular threshold refinement
   - Pattern recognition enhancement
   - Feedback loop integration

## Overview
The Bundle Purchase Opportunities Analysis is a sophisticated feature within the procurement analysis system that identifies potential cost-saving opportunities through bundled purchasing. The analysis uses correlation analysis, purchase pattern recognition, and advanced statistical methods to identify items that could be purchased together for better pricing and efficiency.

## Key Features
- Identification of frequently co-purchased items
- Analysis of purchase pattern correlations
- Supplier-based bundling opportunities
- Potential savings calculations
- Dynamic threshold optimization
- Confidence scoring

## Technical Implementation

### Core Analysis Function
```python
def identify_bundle_opportunities(self, min_correlation: float = 0.6, min_frequency: int = 3) -> Dict:
    """
    Identifies potential bundle purchase opportunities based on:
    1. Items frequently purchased together
    2. Items with correlated purchase patterns
    3. Items from the same supplier with similar order patterns
    """
```

### Analysis Components

#### 1. Purchase Pattern Analysis
- Groups items by transaction date to identify co-purchases
- Creates purchase pattern matrix using cross-tabulation
- Calculates correlation coefficients between items
- Identifies strongly correlated purchase patterns

#### 2. Bundle Identification Process
1. Creates correlation matrix between items
2. Filters correlations based on minimum threshold
3. Validates co-occurrence frequency
4. Calculates potential savings
5. Ranks opportunities by savings potential

#### 3. Savings Calculation
- Assumes 10% standard bundle discount
- Calculates based on average item values
- Considers historical purchase volumes
- Factors in frequency of co-occurrence

## Dynamic Threshold Optimization

### Business Context Factors
1. Business Size
   - Small: Lower thresholds (-0.10 correlation, -1 frequency)
   - Medium: Base thresholds (no adjustment)
   - Large: Higher thresholds (+0.10 correlation, +1 frequency)

2. Industry Type
   - Manufacturing: Higher thresholds (+0.10 correlation, +1 frequency)
   - Retail: Slight reduction (-0.05 correlation)
   - Services: Lower thresholds (-0.10 correlation, -1 frequency)
   - General: No adjustment

3. Risk Tolerance
   - Low: Stricter thresholds (+0.15 correlation, +2 frequency)
   - Medium: Base thresholds
   - High: Relaxed thresholds (-0.15 correlation, -1 frequency)

### Confidence Scoring
The system includes a confidence scoring mechanism that evaluates the reliability of bundle recommendations:

```python
def _calculate_threshold_confidence(self, correlation: float, frequency: int, 
                                 business_size: str, industry: str, 
                                 risk_tolerance: str) -> float:
    confidence = 1.0
    
    # Correlation-based adjustments
    if correlation < 0.5: confidence *= 0.8
    elif correlation > 0.8: confidence *= 0.9
    
    # Frequency-based adjustments
    if frequency < 3: confidence *= 0.85
    elif frequency > 7: confidence *= 0.9
    
    # Context-based adjustments
    if business_size == 'small' and correlation > 0.7:
        confidence *= 0.9
    if industry == 'services' and frequency > 5:
        confidence *= 0.85
    if risk_tolerance == 'low' and correlation < 0.6:
        confidence *= 0.8
    
    return round(confidence, 2)
```

## Output Format

    'bundle_opportunities': [
        {
            'item1_category': str,
            'item1_supplier': str,
            'item2_category': str,

        'total_potential_savings': float,
        'number_of_opportunities': int,
        'average_correlation': float
    }
}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Data Preparation
- Ensure transaction dates are properly formatted
- Clean and standardize category and supplier names
- Remove duplicate transactions
- Handle missing values appropriately

### 2. Threshold Selection
- Start with default thresholds (0.6 correlation, 3 frequency)
- Adjust based on business context
- Monitor and refine based on implementation results
- Consider seasonality effects

### 3. Implementation Guidelines
- Begin with highest-confidence opportunities
- Validate savings calculations with historical data
- Start with smaller bundles (2-3 items) before complex ones
- Regular monitoring and threshold adjustment

## Limitations and Considerations

1. Data Requirements
   - Minimum 6 months of transaction history
   - Consistent category and supplier naming
   - Reliable pricing information

2. Performance Considerations
   - Correlation calculation complexity increases exponentially with item count
   - Memory usage can be significant for large datasets
   - Consider batch processing for very large datasets

3. Business Constraints
   - Supplier capacity limitations
   - Storage and handling requirements
   - Contract terms and conditions
   - Minimum order quantities

## Error Handling
